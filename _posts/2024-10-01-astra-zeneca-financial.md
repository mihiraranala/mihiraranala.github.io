**Introduction**

Astra Zeneca is a British-Swedish pharmaceutical and biotechnology company listed on the London Stock Exchange. It belongs primarily to the pharmaceutical industry. This report examines the company’s financial performance, liquidity, solvency, stock trends, and strategic outlook, comparing it with competitors Merck and Pfizer. The objective is to assess AstraZeneca’s financial health and provide recommendations for sustainable growth.


**Profit and Loss Statement**

The latest annual report was submitted for the FY ending December 31, 2023. The following is a breakdown of the P&L statement.

AstraZeneca has three revenue streams – product sales, alliance revenue, and collaboration revenue. Product sales include all invoices, rebates, returns and chargebacks. Alliance revenue which comprises of income arising from ongoing collaborative agreement with partners. Finally, collaboration revenue includes income arising from collaborative agreements where the partner has sold certain rights with the products. For Fiscal Year 2023, the total revenue was $45,811 million with product sales making up $43,789 million, alliance revenue making up $1,428 million, and collaboration revenue making up $594 million. The total product sales grew by 17.67% from $36,541 million in FY 2021 to $42,998 in FY 2022. However, product sales only grew by 1.83% between FY 2022 and FY 2023, indicating a more stable growth.

Cost of sales include manufacturing costs, royalties, etc. The cost of sales (COS) was $8,268 million which is the total cost required to produce a product or provide a service. The gross profit was $37,543 million, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of sales from the total revenue. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, the cost of sales was significantly higher averaging around $12,400 million. The decrease in the cost of sales indicates an efficiency in producing the products and therefore the company can retain more of their revenue as profits.

Operating expenses include distribution expenses, R&D expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other operating income and expenses. In FY 2023, the operating profit after all operating expenses were $8,193 million. The net profit after all expenses and costs was $5,961 million of which $5,955 million was attributed to the parent company, and $6 million to non-controlling interests. The non-controlling interests include AstraZeneca Pharma India Pvt. Limited, AstraZeneca Indonesia, Beijing Falikang Pharmaceutical, and AstraZeneca Algeria Pharmaceutical Industries. In comparison, the company had only $115 million in net profit in FY 2021. The company had received tax refunds to the tune of $792 million in FY 2022 and $380 million in FY 2021, whereas in FY 2023, they paid $938 million in taxes on their profits.

**Balance Sheet/Financial Position Statement**

AstraZeneca has $101,119 million in total assets as of FY 2023, a rise from $96,483 million in FY 2022, and $105,363 million in FY 2021. The total assets are divided into current and noncurrent assets. Current assets are short-term assets that the company like to convert to cash in the coming year and non-current assets are long-term, fixed assets, essential for long term growth of the company. AstraZeneca’s non-current assets such as plant and equipment, property, investments are worth $76,065 million whereas current assets such as inventories and assets held for sale are about $25,054 million. 

AstraZeneca’s total liabilities were $61, 953 million, an increase from $59,425 million in FY 2022. However, total liabilities in FY 2021 were $66,076 million, 
which was higher than FY 2022. Liabilities were split into current and non-current liabilities. Current liabilities are due within one year whereas noncurrent liabilities are due after one year. In FY 2023, current liabilities ($30,542) were as much as noncurrent liabilities ($31,411), which is a cause of concern since current liabilities must be lesser than noncurrent liabilities. AstraZeneca’s total equity in FY 2023 was $39,166 million, a 5.68% increase from FY 2022’s value of $37,058 million. However, in FY 2021, the total equity was $39,287 million - higher than FY 2022.

Liquidity is how fast a company can convert an asset to cash or liabilities can be paid off. AstraZeneca’s current assets amount to $25,054 million, compared to $30,542 in current liabilities. So, AstraZeneca’s debt in the short-term is more than the assets it can liquidate. The current ratio is therefore 0.82. Solvency refers to the company’s ability to pay its debt and the interest. AstraZeneca’s debt amounted to $31,411 million in FY 2023 and the equity was $39,166 million. A popular solvency ratio is debt-to-equity ratio, which is 0.80 for AstraZeneca. Merck has a current ratio of 1.36 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.86 whereas Pfizer has a current ratio of 1.00 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.72. These ratios indicate that in the short-term, these two companies are more possess more liquidity. While Merck has a similar debt-to-equity ratio to AstraZeneca, Pfizer’s lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates that it borrows less to fund its operations.

**Cash Flow Statement**

AstraZeneca’s net cash inflow from operating activities was $10,435 million as of FY 2023, which included profits before tax, finance income, gains on assets and investments disposal, etc. Net cash inflow was almost double of its FY 2021 value of $5,963 million indicating a higher profits and higher gains. Net cash outflow from investing activities amounted to $4,064 million, which included acquisition of subsidiaries, purchase of property, disposal of non-current assets, etc. Net cash flow from financing activities amounted to $6,657 million, which included payment of dividends, repayment of loans and borrowings, hedge contracts, etc. The cash and cash equivalents at the end of FY 2023 was $5,637, which was a 6.6% drop from FY 2021’s value of $6,038 million. This indicates that the company is spending more for its operations than the money it received in FY 2023 compared to FY 2021. AstraZeneca's earnings per cash profit (EPCP) have increased by 50.76% to £6.33, which indicates a strong cash flow generation (Khorshidi et al., 2024).

**Stock Price Trend**

AstraZeneca (sticker symbol: AZN) was trading at $65.63 as of November 22, 2024. During the 5-year period, the stock price grew by 35.3% from $48.48 in 2019.  In the last one year, while the global pharmaceutical market grew by 2.2%, AstraZeneca grew by 5%, indicating a healthy performance compared to other players. The lowest price for this period was $39.42 in 2020 and the highest stock price was $86.66 in late 2024. The stock has been stable in the last five years as well with a revenue CAGR of 15.7%. In the past month, AstraZeneca’s stock price decreased by almost 8% following news that top Chinese executives were involved in fraud investigations (Manalac, 2024).

**Analysts’ Recommendations**

Morningstar analysts (Morningstar, 2024) say that the company has a large presence in emerging markets which should benefit from the growing markets. The stock is expected to grow and has a target price of $87.67, therefore has a strong buy rating across multiple analysts. AZN also has a huge amount of debt, which brings a bearish perspective from analysts. With the high debt-to-equity ratio, the bearish recommendations are valid. Emerging Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) drugs might affect the high-selling drug Tagrisso. There are also many legal concerns over the development of some rare disease drugs. 

**Financial Forecasting**

Mainly, once the new drugs which are currently in the pipeline are released to the market in the next 3-5 years, they can bring in positive cash flows which will impact the profits and help relieve some of the current liabilities.  Their debt is also high compared to their equity, so the focus should be on getting rid of the long-term debt whilst maintaining financial health (Simply Wall St, n.d.). More budget can be allocated for R&D which will help diversify their portfolio and increase the cashflow from multiple drugs. Although there have not been studies that provide the link between R&D investment and returns, a study shows that by doubling the R&D spending and reducing government risk, the pharmaceutical industry can contribute up to 3% of the GDP (Koijen et al, 2016). AI is also playing a key role in pharmaceutical industry from drug discovery to drug development to clinical trials. Optimizing the drug development process, creating better marketing, and customizing drugs based on the demographic segmentation of the patients can help reduce the cost of sales and marketing and improve profits for AstraZeneca (Vora et al., 2023).
